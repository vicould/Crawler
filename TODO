TODO :
______

 * Introduce arguments using flags (see optparser library), and an interactive mode.
 * Work also with proxies
 * Define an export format (csv ?) in order to be able to recreate a web page from a given link.
 * threading: use a pool of threads, daemonized. Join on the queue, and the programs will exit anyway. Make the threads loop, getting elements to proceed from the data_structure.
