TODO :
______

 * Rewrite the add_links function, should not be using regex to process the page. 
Rather use a Parser on the content, and write some handlers depending on the events.
 * Process the page (get anchors name)
 * Introduce arguments using flags (see optparser library), and an interactive mode.
 * Work also with proxies
 * Restore basic logging functions disappeared because of threading
 * Define an export format (csv ?) in order to be able to recreate a web page from a given link.
